# ğŸš¢ Titanic Passenger Survival Analysis

## ğŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to predict survival outcomes using a machine learning approach. It considers features like **age**, **gender**, **passenger class**, and **family size**. The pipeline includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation using **Random Forest Classifier**

## ğŸ“‚ Datasets
- `train.csv`: Training dataset with passenger features and survival labels.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset without survival labels, used for prediction.

## ğŸ§° Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7+ recommended).

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
